# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

# An input string is valid if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # First opening bracket must be closed after all other opening brackets before it's own closing bracket.

        # Make our stack
        stack = []
        #Iterate through our string
        for char in s:
            if char == '(':

                stack.append(']')
