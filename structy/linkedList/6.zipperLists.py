# Write a function, zipper_lists, that takes in the head of two linked lists as arguments. The function should zipper the two lists together into single linked list by alternating nodes. If one of the linked lists is longer than the other, the resulting list should terminate with the remaining nodes. The function should return the head of the zippered linked list.

# Do this in-place, by mutating the original Nodes.

# You may assume that both input lists are non-empty.

# My iterative solution:

def zipper_lists(head_1, head_2):
  one = head_1
  two = head_2
  
  while one.next and two.next:
    next_one = one.next
    next_two = two.next
    one.next, two.next = two, next_one
    one = next_one
    two = next_two
  if one and two:
    next = one.next
    one.next = two
  if two and next:
    two.next = next
  return head_1

# Alvins iterative solution:
def zipper_lists(head_1, head_2):
  tail = head_1
  current_1 = head_1.next
  current_2 = head_2
  count = 0
  while current_1 is not None and current_2 is not None:
    if count % 2 == 0:
      tail.next = current_2
      current_2 = current_2.next
    else:
      tail.next = current_1
      current_1 = current_1.next
    tail = tail.next
    count += 1
    
  if current_1 is not None:
    tail.next = current_1
  if current_2 is not None:
    tail.next = current_2
    
  return head_1

# Alvin's recursive solution:
def zipper_lists(head_1, head_2):
  if head_1 is None and head_2 is None:
    return None
  if head_1 is None:
    return head_2
  if head_2 is None:
    return head_1
